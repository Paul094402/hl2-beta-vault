            <p>The Half-Life 2 Beta underwent significant changes during its development. Originally envisioned as a darker and more industrial game, it featured elements such as the Combine draining Earth's oceans and replacing the atmosphere with toxic gases. Concepts like the "Hydra," a massive, gelatinous creature, and the "Cremator," an enemy designed to clean the streets, were among the many ideas explored before the final release.

        <div id="secret-content" class="hidden-content">
            <p>Throughout its development, many elements were cut from the Half-Life 2 Beta. Notably, the "Wasteland" setting, which depicted a desolate Earth ravaged by the Combine, was removed. Additionally, characters like the "Consul" and settings such as the "Air Exchange" were part of earlier versions but were ultimately excluded from the final game.
